- Cleans and filters unique, non-null entries
- Groups words with structural similarity using custom logic
- Merges overlapping groups
- Annotates each word with its group name
- Provides frequency analysis of grouped words

## ðŸ“‚ Example Usage
- Excel file: `Data_for_if_statement.xlsx`
- Column name: `column`

## ðŸ“Š Output
- DataFrame with `group` column
- Frequency counts of each group
- Identification of groups with at least two members
